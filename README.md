# Spalculator
A Simple Calculator Made in Python

# IMPORTANT NOTE
USE LOOPS TO CREATE THE BUTTONS!!  
I WAS LAZY TO THINK OF A WAY TO DO IT...  
SO IF YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR OWN,  
MAKE THE BUTTONS USING LOOPS!!!!!!!!!!!!  
  
You have been advised :D  

# Before Running
1. Make sure to have Python3 installed
2. Make sure to have Tkinter installed (Usually already installed with Python)
3. Launch main.py
4. Click the Numbers/Symbols
5. Calculate NUMBERS!

# Install Modules
To install modules required after installing Python3, run in Command Promp/Powershell:
1. pip3 install tkinter

# What's New
1. Fixed Negative Square Root not doing anything
2. Fixed numbers resetting after typing second digit after a symbol (after equating once)
3. Fixed decimal spamming
4. Fixed the way plus-mins button works
5. Fixed many more bugs...
6. Improved the undo (backspace) button
7. The CE button has been renamed to C
8. Added Dark/Light theme switch
9. Added keyboard keybinds
10. Symbol buttons now replaces the original instead of adding more...

# Keybinds
1. All Numbers: NUMPAD or NUMKEYS
2. Addition: +
3. Subtraction: -
4. Multiplication: *
5. Division: /
6. Square Root: Shift + @
7. Change Theme: T
8. Plus-Minus: P
9. Undo: Backspace
10. Cancel: Esc

# Side Note
Still bad coding practices. Use a better way to code this...  
I made this only because I was bored and got nothing better to do...  
So take your time to recode it, and use better practices unlike what I did...
